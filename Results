I used simple Excel to calculate lower and upper bounds around the mean for this distribution of PISA scores.

Mean	 1,525 
Std Dev	 44 

With statistical significance of 5% (typically used), lower and upper bounds for normal distribution are 1454 and 1597 respectively.
All countries except Singapore and HK fall outside this range and we can claim that they are statistically higher compared to other countries.
So I wonder if using these scores for policy decisions would make huge sense.
